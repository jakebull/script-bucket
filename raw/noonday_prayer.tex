\poemtitle{we walked down the beach at chincoteague on a cold march day} 
\begin{verse}
we walked out by the cove. \\
away from the ocean side. \\
in the snow and sand. \\
as the gulls called out midday prayers. \\
cries for fish and friends mixed \\
with the names of god in the cold air.
\end{verse}
