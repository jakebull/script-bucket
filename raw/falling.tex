\begin{verse}
with each step we fall a bit \\
and catch ourselves \\
milliseconds from disaster \\
taking our stable stance, \\
the unfixed immovable I, \\
and throw it off balance \\
so we can proceed. \\
destroying balance for a moment, \\
risking tumbling onto our face, \\
injury, brokenness, embarrassment \\
in order to move forward \\
and we swing our feet so effortlessly \\
while we watch the crosswalk change \\
or talk on the phone \\
absorbed in thought \\
while beneath us \\
a slow series of small miracles unfolds
\end{verse}
