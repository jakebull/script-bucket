\begin{verse}
we have scratched at our parcels for a long time now \\
turning and planting and hoping for rain at the right  \\
time and sun on the right day and everything to be right \\
and we thrilled and shuddered as each sprout promised \\
the harvest one day, one day when we would rest easy, \\
and collapsed as each one wasted or shriveled and  \\
although we knew that our tears could never water  \\
those wasted shoots back to life we cried anyway \\
and went out to collect our meager harvest and returned \\
each day to those dessicated rows to scratch again

and one morning i stepped into that lonely kitchen \\
and you were sitting there without explanation  \\
and the table was laid with cups and plates and \\
filled with eggs and coffee and sausages and toast \\
pushing the warm smell of butter through our bodies \\
and we sat, astonished, grateful, hungry and confused  \\
to the meal we had drempt of and immediately we were \\
ashamed that our own efforts could not bring us to \\
this place and that all of the years of toil and worry \\
had produced little and that now by quiet miracle \\
we had all that we dared not ask for, everything  \\
that we had hidden away in the corner or our hearts \\
reserved for lost hopes and someday dreams

will we sit and enjoy this meal together or \\
will we push it away because we don't deserve it \\
can't abide the fact that sometimes effort is no gift \\
and on certain clear mornings in June before the  \\
sun has cleared the treetops, gifts arrive without effort
\end{verse}
