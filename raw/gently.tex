\poemtitle{gently}
\begin{verse}
I'm laying on the floor \\
doubled over by a knot in my stomach \\
trying to hold the pain there \\
trying to find a way to hold \\
it gently, without anger, resentment \\
fear or shame.

``If I cannot love my wounds \\
how can I help those that are wounded.''

learning to sit quietly with our pain \\
is perhaps the hardest thing.  \\
fleeing, or fixing or preparing \\
to avenge it is much easier than \\
merely being present, it is easier
to make it wait in the car \\
while we go handle this thing.  \\
but when we return it is still there,  \\
waiting silently, hoping for a  \\
gentle embrace that brings quiet, \\
acceptance, reconciled with all of \\
the other painful and beautiful things \\
we must endure every day.

so i lay here, struggling to know how \\
to be present with you, with all of \\
you sunk so deep inside me. scars, scratches, \\
deeper cuts and fractures.

i decide to sing you a lullaby, \\
the same one i sung to you when you were so \\
small, so fragile, so helpless \\
``by the rivers of Babylon, where we set down, \\
and there we wept when we remembered Zion...'' \\
i could never finish that verse without \\
crying myself. warm tears rolling onto your \\
soft infant's hair.

and as i finish, my hand resting on that spot, \\
tears rolling through my own hair now, \\
i feel it begin to slowly melt. 
\end{verse}
