\begin{verse}
there is only one question God has for us \\
and it is a simple one, and easy to answer. \\
but it is hard to contemplate, and harder to  \\
answer honestly. because to give an honest answer \\
means that we have considered all of the questions \\
posed by the question and followed that chain of \\
reasoning down its long trail of logic to the point \\
where we find that the obvious conclusion is much \\
harder to answer and more frightening to commit to. 

``do you love me?'' - simple enough, but impossibly hard. \\
it is not a requirement, prerequisite or demand. \\
it is the omega, the conclusion we must reach \\
if we struggle through to the point where we understand \\
what it must mean. because God doesn't know, \\
because really it is hard to tell when someone loves \\
you and when they are willing to simply say it \\
so you can move on with your life, accept the flowers \\
and valentines cards and know that this emptiness  \\
is not what love really is. because it is hard to  \\
tell from our actions whether or not we respect this  \\
creation, understand our equivalence, know that finally \\
God simply wants to know if you have discovered that you can love yourself
