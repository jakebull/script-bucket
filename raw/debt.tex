\poemtitle{debt}
\begin{verse}
are we owed this love? \\
is it something we are entitled to? \\
did we accumulate a deficit of love \\
and closeness over the years? \\
did all the love others took from us \\
or squandered or misused go into an \\
escrow account somewhere? and now we \\
are being repaid? made whole, compensated?

we act as if we don't deserve it at all. \\
as if this weren't really meant for us. \\
we pretend that we have fallen upon a treasure \\
that will soon be reclaimed by its true owner \\
who will happily possess it and control it \\
and if we are lucky give us a few coins in thanks.

perhaps it is neither. perhaps love is only \\
valuable to those who posses it. nontransferable, \\
bearer only, unpayable and unreceivable. \\
maybe it is something that we could only create now \\
not because we are owed or have earned it, but \\
because it is possible, and we have finally realized it.
\end{verse}
