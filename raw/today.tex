\poemtitle{today} 
\begin{verse}
if you love me today that is enough \\
if tomorrow comes and love still rests here \\
that is a blessing for tomorrow.

if tomorrow comes and love has gone, \\
or turned to struggle or power or disdain \\
then that will be a sadness for tomorrow.

i''m not sure i can love you without desire, \\
without attachment, longing, doubt, striving, \\
but i can love you today, and that is enough.
\end{verse}
