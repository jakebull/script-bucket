\poemtitle{passion}
\begin{verse}
what if it doesn't burn? \\
what if it does not turn to ash  \\
whatever fuel it is within us that  \\
love ignites and so greedily consumes? \\
is it possible to live this unscorched, \\
without blister, singe or scar? 

what if instead our love fell like \\
dew on a bed of moss in midsummer? \\
dampening roots and trickling through \\
the leaves, in silver drops clinging  \\
to the lotus and tiny rivulets \\
creeping through dead leaves after  \\
one of those thunderstorms on a hot \\
day that leaves the air thick and still. 

rather than crackling hot then slowly exhausting \\
itself as sparks gasping amongst the coals, \\
could our passion sink down into our roots, cooling \\
for a season, lying dormant surrounded by \\
fallen leaves, musty ground waiting  \\
for the first warm day of Spring to \\
gently explode, each stem and leaf?
\end{verse}
