\poemtitle{We rented a paddle boat at the reflecting pool}
\begin{verse}
The distance between the Jefferson and King memorials is longer than you think \\
On this hot day peddling and peddling between those granite walls. \\
Like any body of water it stretches in the infinite expanse \\
between the land we crave and the water we fear \\
everything merges in the heat and the wet \\
the great white man in a deep amber bronze  \\
filling us with ideas that others fought for \\
bringing us to this point we enjoy so effortlessly. \\
and across this expanse of a hot afternoon \\
the great black man in bleached marble, \\
murdered in the great prophetic tradition, \\
surrounded by his message: \\
peace is a weapon that requires no target. \\
before it gunpowder is just smoke \\
neutrons rest quietly with protons \\
we cannot forget that we share  \\
all of this this fear and power,  \\
anger and suspicion and \\
distance turning \\
to love
\end{verse}
