\poemtitle{Everything is practice}
\begin{verse}
We argue and argue \\
about our natural talents  \\
what we are built to do  \\
what the fates create for us \\
vice what we build ourselves \\
what is just determination \\
that slow grind to perfection \\
each brick in its place \\
creating the Albert Hall, \\
or some edifice only we can see. \\
maybe we are arguing about nothing \\
(most of our arguments rest there) \\
and what you do is what  \\
you were meant to do. \\
all of your life  \\
just following yourself
\end{verse}
