\begin{verse}[\versewidth]

when i finally said i was glad to meet you  \\
did you understand which cipher i used?

you didn't seem inclined to tinker with a puzzle. \\
enough people spoke to you directly \\
that you needn't waste time on my text, \\
the layers of doubt and fabrication, \\
with a cover too plain to be taken seriously 

probably the message wasn't worth the struggle. \\
i'm sure you knew, that little joke amongst you \\
(he's so sincere, so clumsy and unsure, \\
but really not something to be bothered with now). \\
maybe i tell myself this so i can pretend \\
that all the risks i took preparing that message \\
gave me that smug sacrifice,  \\
knowing that no one could ever know 

convolution of what i wanted to say so plainly \\
so i didn't risk disclosure, couldn't be held responsible, \\
wouldn't expose what my heart wanted me to say \\
to that uncompromising world where sometimes \\
when you smile and fall into someone's arms \\
you just fall
\end{verse}
