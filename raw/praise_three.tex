\begin{verse}
tonight i will sleep without you \\
i will rest undisturbed, unencumbered \\
i will not wake clammy and hot stuck against you \\
we will not stir half-awake and grapple together \\
pulling clothes and sheets, rolling in bliss \\
for those few moments that seem like forever. \\
my arms and legs and hips will not go numb beneath me \\
as your head arms and chest press close to me \\
and your slow breath or little snores will not \\
sing me back to sleep or give me something to focus \\
on as i drift between consciousness and not. 

and my mind will find its own way tonight \\
and not worry about disturbing you, or figuring \\
how translate the gentle river of my love into \\
words that are appropriate to this time and place \\
or sitting frozen, unable to decide whether i should 
move my arm and disturb you, or wait a moment longer \\
to smell your hair and feel your breath on my chest

tonight i will only reflect on these things \\
remember your hair, arms and lips and try to \\
recall how they felt against my lips and hands \\
i will be grateful for my own space \\
even if i only use it to think about you
\end{verse}
