\settowidth\versewidth{inconsolable, it goes on until it is inexplicable}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
my heart cries out to an unfamiliar world \\
fussy, confused, overwhelmed, unsure. \\
inconsolable, it goes on until it is inexplicable \\
that there could be one more tear in this vessel.

I dreamt that you came and scooped it up, \\
held it close to you, gently whispering \\
pure comfort and peace between you, \\
until at last, with a little sigh, \\
it falls asleep in your arms
\end{verse}
