\begin{verse}
is this urgent longing part of our practice now?
have we reached this place to pause and
reenact the old chip and dale cartoon?
each urging the other to step first over
this precipice we reached skipping through
the soft fields of summer. we knew where 
we were going, so easy, so fun, ignoring
the destination we had reached before.

and now we jump, or not, or pause, or stop.
one must go first but we must go together
and we know if the other stops we will fall
alone, or fall out of sync and spend eternity
grasping for each other, just out of reach.

we know what the landing feels like and
we fear it. we can''t reasonably expect that
this time is different, the probability is 
negligible, the likely outcome the same. 

but it is time my love, for it is the only
way forward and we are not prepared to
stop yet, though we both would say we might.
take my hand firmly, and take a deep breath,
so that we can find faith and trust so
that hope visits us for a moment and
gives us courage so we can leap together at last.
\end{verse}
