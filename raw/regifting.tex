\settowidth\versewidth{some incomprehensible artifact of your memory}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
what is this thing you have given me? \\
what did you mean by giving it? \\
was it useful, or whimsical? \\
did it point at a failing in me \\
or a wish for me to improve? \\
some gap between us that i might fill, \\
a broom because the floor was always dirty? \\
tool, gadget, art, or just a souvenir \\
some incomprehensible artifact of your memory \\
recalling what i would be in the future. \\
maybe after i awakened to the cold morning \\
and realized that you didn't know the answer, \\
that it would be what it became to me.

so i think i will give it to someone else \\
not bothering to wrap it  \\
or make them open it in front of everyone, \\
(because a gift cannot have an expectation) \\
for you, to use how you see fit
\end{verse}
