\poemtitle{gray}
\begin{verse}
today was gray \\
with the sky the color \\
of a cold steel blanket \\
mediocre light reflecting \\
everywhere off of every \\
surface of the snow \\
illuminating everything in us. \\
those things we can't see \\
in the sunlight.

a day that could crush you \\
show you where you are \\
where your tears could \\
scoop you up and pull you \\
round like a wave \\
circling in space \\
then crushing you into the earth \\
reminding you  \\
of your smallness
\end{verse}
