\begin{verse}
lie down next to me,\\
and place your hand near my waist \\
rest here a moment and let's breath a bit \\
or exchange a few simple kisses 

now try something harder. \\
lie quietly and imagine a place \\
where you wish you never were \\
where you weren''t loved like you are now \\
where no one would ever love you again 

stay there a moment and think how \\
you could hold yourself then \\
so that you could know that now \\
that you can be loved, and can love in return 

and hold me that way now \\
arms and legs pressed close \\
or held loosely, slowly stroking my hair. \\
because i was there once also \\
and yet i have arrived here with you

hold me closer until you feel my heart beat \\
until there is no time or space between us, \\
and let our hearts confer on this matter, \\
in their slow steady voices that whisper peace. \\
and let them resolve it. \\
while we recline in the truth that love is present now
\end{verse}
