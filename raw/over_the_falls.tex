\poemtitle{over the falls}
\begin{verse}
these transitions always disorient me \\
one minute floating along \\
the next underfoot of something i can't control \\
pitched forward, underway, _i can see the moment \\
when i transition from the smooth surface \\
diving forward headlong to the place \\
where i can't see the outcome, an observer of myself \\
descending, pushed under, returning  to the source. \\
so long ago we stepped out of the sea. \\
i’m back now, swirling to the bottom \\
the great weight returning me to the deep for a brief visit. \\
enveloped in that mad heart, that indifferent power \\
the gentle embrace of the sea crushing my frailness \\
swallowing me for a second before it hands me back \\
to the world i know with grace i cannot comprehend

i remember you driving me away from college \\
turning onto lakeside drive \\
my face toward the window, tears flowing out of me \\
inexplicably, so glad to be leaving, so unsure. \\
ashamed because i couldn't understand \\
how being swallowed by the void could be frightening. \\
the great release, being pitched forward  \\
moving from where i was to whatever i might be next
\end{verse}
