\begin{verse}
i''m sitting on the floor with my doubt \\
perched on a seat pretending to be off \\
on some spiritual quest, figuring out \\
how to hold my doubt so we can be  \\
in the same room without that fighting tension

but my doubt isn't like my anger, which \\
simply wants to be held and soothed until \\
it slowly melts. my doubt is much more \\
forceful, unwilling to be cajoled, tauting \\
me back to the place where i engage in that \\
epic battle of questions, critique and fear 

what will it take for us to rest together \\
quietly reflecting on the wretchedness of \\
the past we have gone over so often together \\
and then laugh like children on the playground \\
during the first warn day of Spring?

\end{verse}
