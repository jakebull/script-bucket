\begin{verse}
%% In the Rohitassa Sutta, The Buddha states: ''In this very one-fathom-long body, along with its perceptions and thoughts, do I proclaim the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world, and the path leading to the cessation of the world'' 
i woke this morning wanting to pray \\
not knowing what to pray to or on \\
listening to you sleep i awoke to \\
the miracle of your body \\
taking your hand in mine \\
hallelujah it is small and rough from work \\
caressing your arm \\
hallelujah it moves and softens at my touch \\
moving your shoulders \\
hallelujah they free as I circle them \\
running my hands up your neck \\
hallelujah it lengthens as you let go \\
holding your head firmly  \\
hallelujah you relax as i circle your temples \\
running my hands down to your heart \\
hallelujah i feel it swell and open \\
holding your breasts for a moment \\
hallelujah you rise to my touch \\
running my hands over your belly \\
hallelujah you breathe again \\
pressing into your roots \\
hallelujah you open and relax \\
squeezing through your thighs  \\
hallelujah your blood flows upward \\
holding firmly to your knees  \\
hallelujah they relax \\
grasping your feet \\
hallelujah they open and release \\
stroking your calves  \\
hallelujah you tingle \\
turning your thighs  \\
hallelujah you release in your roots \\
massaging your buttocks \\
hallelujah you awaken again \\
pressing into your sacrum \\
hallelujah you find balance again \\
running my hands over your back \\
hallelujah your spine reawakens \\
pressing into your spine \\
hallelujah you begin to flow \\
grasping your crown \\
hallelujah your breath fills us both

light of lights \\
miracle of miracles \\
we breathe and move \\
hold and release \\
expand and contract \\
and know we are alive \\
image of the holy  \\
light given form \\
ether given weight \\
a hammer to forge our world, \\
fashion a vessel to hold this love, \\
to proclaim the blessing we can create
