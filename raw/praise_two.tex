\begin{poem}
come stand by me and let us walk \\
down by the river on this cool clear day \\
side by side on the wide path \\
or single file as it narrows \\
into a muddy track by the point \\
watching the ebb and flow of the river

let's stand together and raise  \\
our hands to the sky holding tight \\
stretch until we reach the sun \\
and welcome this day
\end{poem}
