\poemtitle{don't say it}
\begin{verse}
do not go to you brother and tell him you love him\\
  until you have said it to yourself\\
do not hold your sister in her loss\\
  until you can hold your own losses\\
do not claim to love your mother\\
  until you expound true love for yourself\\
do no talk of your love and respect for your father\\
  until everyone can see your love and respect for yourself\\
    without you uttering a word.
\end{verse}
