\begin{verse}
my anger spends most of its time on the couch \\
just hanging with my righteous indignation \\
barely noticing as i interrupt their view \\
of the television as i return from work, \\
tired and neglectful, forgetting that they \\
depend on me for sustenance. \\
sometimes i take them out, \\
usually in the car, \\
(typically when i’m late) \\
and thinking that our numbers \\
will make me more impressive.

it takes grace to be present  \\
as someone approaches death \\
the slow paced journey of the frail \\
each day being the same as the last \\
and suddenly there you are \\
standing by seeing it happen \\
wondering what you had forgotten, \\
what remains to be done \\
berating yourself for waiting so long, \\
but pleading that you didn’t know this was the day

when it is time for someone to go, \\
a dear friend or a useless emotion, \\
how can you say ``it’s time'', \\
the kind thing to do is to stop here \\
and say goodbye, \\
but you travel a little farther \\
because you can’t let go. \\
greedy bastard holding onto them. \\
hoping when it is your time \\
you won’t slip away unnoticed.
\end{verse}
