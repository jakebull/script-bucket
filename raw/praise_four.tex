\begin{verse}
i sit here in grim determination 
to love you completely
to be all that you need
to ensure that you are satisfied
to prove that this is all love can be

without proof of love 
how can we know we are complete?
how can we rest quietly knowing 
that nothing more is needed?
how can one risk something as 
powerful as love without certainty?
how can we make this purchase
and receive no warranty?

if i could wait quietly for love
i would understand that it must be
incomplete, malleable, fluid
that what seems to be solidifying
will drip away tomorrow if we 
apply the right heat
of control or anger or succumb to
the fears that are our other steadfast love

i will try harder to wait for your love
determined to be gentle, to be incomplete
to understand that love is not a barrier
to be overcome by stopping my fears
and repairing all my broken places shiny new
but it is a river we must float upon
or cross over or channel to our fields
to transport us or sustain us,
but we command it at our peril
\end{verse}
