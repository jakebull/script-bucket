\begin{verse}
now i understand, in a way i couldn't before,
where this sadness comes from
how you failed your self, suffered
punished you feel for your weakness
allowing yourself to be blown off course
pulled into the strait without warning
though you knew it was close by
how this body failed you
as you failed yourself
how you face disease as judgment
condemned to being human
never all right, never quite wrong

when we take a thought and bury it
where does it lie? 
what ground holds our fears and doubts?
because they do not leave us
they must be buried under our skin
deep within or muscles and ligaments
but because we live our fears remain
alive in us, nagging our joints,
a twinge in the knee as we try to 
sidestep our past. the farther down they go
the more we hold them so that we are
most present to our deepest fears.

\end{verse}
