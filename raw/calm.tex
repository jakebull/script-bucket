\poemtitle{calm} 
\begin{verse}
i sit at the table\\
my heart ripped out \\
and laid before me\\
still beating \\
blood pouring out with \\
each gasping beat\\
and i watched, patently,\\
with awareness and compassion\\
as i expired and exhausted

so i bought an elixir,\\
a serum, a box of happiness\\
that said ``calm'' on the package.\\
that promised relief,\\
balance,\\
harmony,\\
no pain

and wound in the letters was a\\
picture of the Caribbean.\\
turquoise water against a blue sky.\\
and i immediately thought,\\
the Caribbean is dull,\\
calm, lifeless, preparing for death

to feel calm i need a good groundswell,\\
overhead waves jacking up on the bar\\
and detonating mercilessly into the sand

without the power of the earth i can only feel dullness\\
inhibition, inaction\\
a sea that caresses and cajoles you into solumunence.\\
while the swell  picks you up, spins you\\
and holds you under until you feel eternity bearing \\
down on your chest and are unsure of which way means\\
escape from this uncompromising presence.\\
until you realize that your life is precious\\
and therefore, unbelievably fragile,\\
hanging by a thread in a sea that seems intent\\
on stealing your life, reminding you \\
that grace is the only escape from this nauseous turning,\\
you will not find equanimity in this world

until you have stared wild eyed at the sea \\
gloriously destroying the toys we have left \\
at the seaside, rising up to capture us\\
and bring us home to the deep\\
you have not felt calm.\\
you do not know the origin of peace.
\end{verse}
