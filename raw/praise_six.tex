\begin{verse}
i will not wake you my love \\
but i will lie still and listen \\
to the slow deep regular tide of \\
your breath wash over me and \\
the swirl of your hair gently brush me \\
or tickle my nose as i try to be still

and listen with all my attention \\
for any change, any sign that you \\
can feel my heart fill to bursting
\end{verse}
