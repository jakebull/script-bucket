\begin{verse}
i remember sitting in Eckhart\\
reading a book or maybe a journal article\\
and it said that it would be great if\\
someone picked up this text and read it.\\
it would be better if someone took the \\
time and effort to understand what it said\\
but the greatest benefit would come if the\\
reader would set the book down \\
and explore on her own.

do this now.
