\begin{verse}
we walked down the streets tonight \\ 
stopping at each tree to admire \\
the delicate orchid-like blossoms. \\
stepping out into the cool evening \\
that moments ago seemed so close and warm. \\
looking for a scent that may or \\
may not be there. \\
changeable, unsure, directionless \\
at each corner we could turn so many ways. \\
us and the weather, unsure of which way to go next.
\end{verse}
